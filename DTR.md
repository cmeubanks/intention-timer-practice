Project: Intention Timer

Group Member Names: Marika Shanahan & Caroline Eubanks

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
* Caroline: solidify css styling
* Marika: become more confident in JSON storage and touch some element of css animation
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
* Both quite flexible, open to asking for help from multiple sources, balanced working style between leadership and supporting roles

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
* Problem solve from multiple angles, flexible timing and drive to complete the iterations with quality and depth, delegating tasks in an efficient manner and holding one another accountable

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
* With the exception of allocated project work time, in the morning before class and early evening are mutually agreed free periods to collaborate. Early evening will be preferable but will be addressed as the team progresses through the project. No formal constraints but to respect personal time primarily in the early morning and late evening. 

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
* Slack, phone when necessary, tuple for experimentation purposes.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
* Caroline: function syntax, event listeners, manipulating DOM elements, and overall html layout, desire to improve classes and instances of classes in css and css foundations overall
* Marika: javascript foundations, picking up new concepts, desire to improve refactoring from multiple perspectives and the aforementioned css animations and JSON storage

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* Pairing is expected to take up the majority of the workload for this project so most if not all features will be in a collaborative context

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
* Conflicts and syntax adjustments will be mutually agreed upon before merging

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
* Chrome extension perhaps for individual purposes, while pairing keep open communication for breaks

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Feedback will be constructive and take into account the interactions and conversation over pairing, 5-minute stand up reflection at the end of each days agreed upon pairing time for higher level thoughts 

Additional Remote Considerations:
* After further conversation there are clear differences in opinion of how to deliver feedback and in primary values of how to assess professionalism overall.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
* Github Projects when necessary

Day 1 Agenda:
